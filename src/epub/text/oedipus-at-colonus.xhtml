								<span>Poseidon, from whose altar I was raised,</span>

								<span>With warrant from the monarch of this land,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To parley with you, and depart unscathed.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>I have been banished from my native land</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Because by right of primogeniture</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I claimed possession of thy sovereign throne</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Of this I deem the curse that rests on thee.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So likewise hold the soothsayers, for when</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I came to Argos in the Dorian land</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And took the king Adrastus’ child to wife,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Under my standard I enlisted all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The foremost captains of the Apian isle,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To levy with their aid that sevenfold host</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of spearmen against Thebes, determining</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To oust my foes or die in a just cause.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why then, thou askest, am I here today?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Father, I come a suppliant to thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Both for myself and my allies who now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With squadrons seven beneath their seven spears</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beleaguer all the plain that circles Thebes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Foremost the peerless warrior, peerless seer,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Amphiaraiis with his lightning lance;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Next an Aetolian, Tydeus, Oeneus’ son;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Eteoclus of Argive birth the third;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fourth Hippomedon, sent to the war</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By his sire Talaos; Capaneus, the fifth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Vaunts he will fire and raze the town; the sixth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Parthenopaeus, an Arcadian born</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Named of that maid, longtime a maid and late</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Espoused, Atalanta’s true-born child;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Last I thy son, or thine at least in name,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If but the bastard of an evil fate,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lead against Thebes the fearless Argive host.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus by thy children and thy life, my sire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We all adjure thee to remit thy wrath</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And favour one who seeks a just revenge</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Against a brother who has banned and robbed him.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For victory, if oracles speak true,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will fall to those who have thee for ally.</span>

								<span>Thy question hits the marvel of the tale.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How he moved hence, you saw him and must know;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Without a friend to lead the way, himself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Guiding us all. So having reached the abrupt</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Earth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He paused at one of the converging paths,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hard by the rocky basin which records</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The pact of Theseus and Peirithous.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Betwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Midway he sat and loosed his beggar’s weeds;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then calling to his daughters bade them fetch</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of running water, both to wash withal</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And make libation; so they clomb the steep,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Demeter’s hill, who waters the green shoots;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in brief space brought what their father bade,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then laved and dressed him with observance due.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But when he had his will in everything,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And no desire was left unsatisfied,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It thundered from the netherworld; the maids</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shivered, and crouching at their father’s knees</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Folded his arms about them both and said,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“My children, ye will lose your sire today,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For all of me has perished, and no more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have ye to bear your long, long ministry;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A heavy load, I know, and yet one word</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wipes out all score of tribulations⁠—<em>love</em>.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And love from me ye had⁠—from no man more;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But now must live without me all your days.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So clinging to each other sobbed and wept</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Father and daughters both, but when at last</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their mourning had an end and no wail rose,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A moment there was silence; suddenly</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A voice that summoned him; with sudden dread</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The hair of all stood up and all were ’mazed;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Too long, too long thy passing is delayed.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But when he heard the summons of the god,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Prince came nearer: “O my friend,” he cried,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, daughters, give him yours⁠—and promise me</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou never wilt forsake them, but do all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That time and friendship prompt in their behoof.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And he of his nobility repressed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His tears and swore to be their constant friend.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This promise given, Oedipus put forth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Blind hands and laid them on his children, saying,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“O children, prove your true nobility</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hence depart nor seek to witness sights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unlawful or to hear unlawful words.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our ruler, to behold what next shall hap.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So we all heard him speak, and weeping sore</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We companied the maidens on their way.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>After brief space we looked again, and lo</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The man was gone, evanished from our eyes;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Only the king we saw with upraised hand</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shading his eyes as from some awful sight,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That no man might endure to look upon.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A moment later, and we saw him bend</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But by what doom the stranger met his end</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No man save Theseus knoweth. For there fell</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No fiery bold that reft him in that hour,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was a messenger from heaven, or else</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some gentle, painless cleaving of earth’s base;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For without wailing or disease or pain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He passed away⁠—and end most marvellous.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And if to some my tale seems foolishness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am content that such could count me fool.</span>
